  - `-i`: The `-i` option runs the code in the file you provide, then opens an interactive session (with a `>>>` prompt). You can then evaluate expressions, for example calling functions you defined. To exit, type `exit()`. You can also use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl-D on Linux/Mac machines or Ctrl-Z Enter on Windows.   
  If you edit the Python file while running it interactively, you will need to exit and restart the interpreter in order for those changes to take effect.
  - `-m doctest`: Runs the doctests in a file, which are the examples in the docstrings of functions.   
  Each test in the file consists of `>>>` followed by some Python code and the expected output.
